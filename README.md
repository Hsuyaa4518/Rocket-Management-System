# Rocket Management System GUI Development Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for rocket management systems. The GUI serves as the primary interface between ground control teams and rocket systems, supporting all stages of mission management—from pre-launch monitoring to real-time data visualization, emergency control, and post-flight analysis.

## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose**: This document outlines the requirements, structure, and implementation methods for building a functional GUI for rocket system management.
- **Scope**: The GUI will support tasks including pre-launch checks, launch sequence, real-time monitoring, telemetry data processing, and emergency protocols.

## 2. System Requirements

- **Hardware**: 
  - Minimum display resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD), multi-monitor support preferred
  - Minimum of 16GB RAM
  - OpenGL-supported graphics card for rendering high-quality visualizations
  - Recommended: SSD for faster loading times and smoother data processing

- **Software**: 
  - Cross-platform compatibility is essential, and we recommend using frameworks like:
    - Qt (with PyQt/PySide) for Python-based development
    - JavaFX for Java-based development
  - Recommended Python version: **3.8+**
  - Dependencies: 
    - PyQt5 or Tkinter (for GUI elements)
    - Matplotlib or PyQtGraph (for data visualization)
    - NumPy and Pandas (for data processing)
  
Ensure that you have the required libraries installed before starting development. You can use `pip` to install dependencies for Python-based setups:
```bash
pip install PyQt5 matplotlib pyqtgraph numpy pandas
```

## 3. Core Components

- **Main Dashboard**: Displays mission status, system health, critical parameters, alerts, mission clock, and weather data. It provides a quick overview of the system's state and allows users to navigate to other sections.
- **Telemetry Display**: Real-time data visualization for rocket telemetry, including sensor data, tracking, altitude, fuel levels, and engine status. Data should be continuously updated from the rocket’s telemetry system.
- **Command and Control Interface**: Provides options for launching, aborting, or controlling the mission. This interface includes emergency control systems, abort options, and manual overrides for various critical systems.
- **Data Logging**: Logs important system events, actions, and errors for review during and after the mission. Logs should be exportable in CSV or JSON format for further analysis.

### Interaction Flow

1. **Main Dashboard** displays high-level data (status, weather, mission clock).
2. **Telemetry Display** updates with real-time sensor data.
3. Users can issue commands through the **Command and Control Interface**.
4. All system interactions, including warnings, alerts, and user inputs, are logged in the **Data Logging** system.

## 4. Design Principles

- **User-Friendly**: The layout should be high-contrast, with clear sections and buttons that allow quick decision-making, especially during critical events.
- **Responsive**: The GUI must be optimized for various screen sizes, supporting multi-monitor setups for better space utilization.
- **Accessibility**: The interface should support high-contrast mode and keyboard shortcuts for accessibility in emergency situations.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Information should update in real time with minimal delay to support decision-making during the mission.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

- **Code Structure**: 
  The `RocketGUI` class will organize the main window setup, telemetry, and control panels. Each component (Dashboard, Telemetry, Controls) will be encapsulated in its own class to maintain modularity. A clear separation of concerns between the GUI and the backend data processing is crucial for maintainability.

- **Data Handling**: 
  - Telemetry data should be handled in a real-time processing pipeline, validating and displaying updated values every second or as required by the mission timeline.
  - Error handling should be implemented for failed data transmissions, and fallback strategies (e.g., default values or retries) should be in place.

## 6. Safety Considerations

- **Critical Command Verification**: Implement two-step verification for commands that could affect the mission’s safety, such as launch and abort operations.
- **Automated Health Checks**: The system should automatically check for anomalies in the rocket’s health, including fuel levels, engine status, and telemetry integrity, at regular intervals.
- **Secure Communication**: Ensure that all data transmitted between the rocket and ground control is encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL).

## 7. Best Practices

- **Modular Development**: Keep each system (dashboard, telemetry, etc.) in a separate module to make maintenance easier and allow for scalable additions (e.g., adding more sensor displays).
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control to track code changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Performance Optimization**: Manage system resources carefully, especially during real-time data processing, to ensure smooth performance even under load.

## 8. Testing and Validation

- **Unit Testing**: Ensure individual components (such as telemetry displays and command inputs) function correctly with isolated tests.
- **Integration Testing**: Test how the components interact with each other, e.g., when telemetry data is updated, ensure the Dashboard reflects changes correctly.
- **Performance Testing**: Stress test the system to handle high-frequency telemetry data without causing UI lags or crashes.
- **Safety Tests**: Test scenarios with failed telemetry or lost communication, verifying that the system provides appropriate warnings or fallback actions.

## 9. Resources and Tools

- **Development Tools**: 
  - IDE: Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for Python, IntelliJ IDEA for Java
  - UI Design Software: Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch for creating wireframes and mockups
  - Testing Frameworks: pytest (Python), JUnit (Java)
  - Version Control: GitHub or GitLab

## 10. Getting Started

1. **Set Up the Environment**: 
   - Install Python and required libraries (as mentioned above) or Java and JavaFX for Java-based setups.
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
   
2. **Run the Application**:
   - In Python, run the main script using:
     ```bash
     python rocket_gui.py
     ```
   - In Java, compile and run using your IDE or command line.

3. **First Steps**: 
   - Familiarize yourself with the main dashboard. Begin by adding dummy telemetry data to see how the interface updates.
   - Gradually build out the telemetry display and control interface as you integrate real sensor data.
