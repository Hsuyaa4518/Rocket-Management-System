# Rocket Management System GUI Development Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for rocket management systems. The GUI is designed as the primary interface between ground control teams and rocket systems, supporting all stages of mission managementâ€”from pre-launch monitoring to real-time data visualization, emergency control, and post-flight analysis.

## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose**: This document outlines the requirements, structure, and implementation methods for building a functional GUI for rocket system management.
- **Scope**: Supports tasks including pre-launch checks, launch sequence, real-time monitoring, telemetry data processing, and emergency protocols.

## 2. System Requirements

- **Hardware**: Minimum display resolution of 1920x1080, multi-monitor support, minimum of 16GB RAM, and OpenGL-supported graphics card.
- **Software**: Cross-platform compatibility with development options such as Qt, Python with PyQt/Tkinter, or Java with JavaFX.

## 3. Core Components

- **Main Dashboard**: Displays mission status, system health, critical parameters, alerts, mission clock, and weather data.
- **Telemetry Display**: Real-time data visualization, including sensor data, tracking, altitude, and fuel levels.
- **Command and Control Interface**: Launch and emergency control systems, including abort options and overrides.
- **Data Logging**: Automated event and action logging with export capabilities.

## 4. Design Principles

Focus on a high-contrast, user-friendly layout that supports accessibility and efficient navigation, optimized for high-stakes operations.

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

- **Code Structure**: The `RocketGUI` class organizes main window setup, telemetry, and control panels with modularity in mind.
- **Data Handling**: Emphasis on real-time processing, validation, and error handling to ensure seamless data flow.

## 6. Safety Considerations

- Includes two-step verification for critical commands, automated checks, redundancy, and secure communication.

## 7. Best Practices

Follow modular development, use version control, and conduct regular code reviews. Optimize performance by managing resources efficiently.

## 8. Testing and Validation

Thorough testing covers unit, integration, and performance, focusing on UI, safety features, and error handling.

## 9. Resources and Tools

Development tools include IDEs, UI design software, testing frameworks, and version control systems.
